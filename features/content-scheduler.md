    <h2>What is Content Scheduler?</h2>
    <p>
        Content Scheduler is a powerful automation tool that allows you to plan, schedule, and automatically post your LinkedIn content at predetermined times. By maintaining a consistent posting cadence, you can significantly increase your LinkedIn visibility, engagement, and follower growth.
    </p>
    <p>
        Consistency is a key factor in LinkedIn's algorithm. Accounts that post regularly are rewarded with better reach and engagement. Content Scheduler ensures you maintain this consistency even during busy periods or when you're unavailable.
    </p>

    <div class="bg-gray-100 dark:bg-gray-700 p-4 rounded-lg my-6">
        <h4 class="font-semibold mb-2">Recommended Posting Schedule</h4>
        <p class="text-gray-600 dark:text-gray-300 mb-4">
            Based on our analysis of millions of LinkedIn posts, we recommend these posting times for maximum engagement:
        </p>
        <ul class="text-gray-600 dark:text-gray-300">
            <li><strong>Tuesday - Thursday:</strong> 8:30-9:30 AM, 12:00-1:00 PM, 5:00-6:00 PM (local time)</li>
            <li><strong>Monday & Friday:</strong> 10:00-11:00 AM, 3:00-4:00 PM (local time)</li>
            <li><strong>Weekend:</strong> If posting on weekends, 11:00 AM-12:00 PM performs best</li>
        </ul>
    </div>
    
    <h3>Adding Content to Your Queue</h3>
    <p>
        Once your schedule is set, you can add content to your queue:
    </p>
    
    <ol>
        <li>Click the <strong>+ Create Post</strong> button</li>
        <li>Write your post or paste content from Power Writer</li>
        <li>Add media (images, documents, etc.) if desired</li>
        <li>Preview how your post will appear on LinkedIn</li>
        <li>Click <strong>Add to Queue</strong> to schedule the post</li>
    </ol>
    
    <p>
        Your post will automatically be assigned to the next available slot in your schedule. You can also choose specific posting times by clicking <strong>Schedule for specific time</strong> instead of <strong>Add to Queue</strong>.
    </p>
    
    <h3>Managing Your Content Queue</h3>
    <p>
        The Content Calendar view provides an overview of your scheduled content:
    </p>
    
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Drag and drop</strong> posts to rearrange their order</li>
        <li><strong>Edit</strong> scheduled posts by clicking on them</li>
        <li><strong>Delete</strong> posts by clicking the trash icon</li>
        <li><strong>Duplicate</strong> posts to reuse popular content</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h3>Post Recycling</h3>
    <p>
        For evergreen content that can be reused, Content Scheduler offers a recycling option:
    </p>
    
    <ol>
        <li>When creating or editing a post, toggle the <strong>Recycle this post</strong> option</li>
        <li>Set a <strong>Recycling interval</strong> (30, 60, or 90 days recommended)</li>
        <li>Specify a <strong>Maximum recycle count</strong> (optional)</li>
    </ol>
    
    <p>
        When a recycled post is published, it will automatically be added back to the end of your queue with the specified interval.
    </p>
    
    <h2>Best Practices for LinkedIn Scheduling</h2>
    
    <h3>Optimal Posting Frequency</h3>
    <p>
        Finding the right posting frequency depends on your audience and goals:
    </p>
    
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Minimum recommended:</strong> 2-3 posts per week</li>
        <li><strong>Ideal for growth:</strong> 4-5 posts per week</li>
        <li><strong>Maximum effective:</strong> 1-2 posts per day</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>
        Posting more than twice per day can lead to audience fatigue and diminishing returns. Quality always trumps quantity on LinkedIn.
    </p>
    
    <h3>Content Mix Strategy</h3>
    <p>
        For the most engaging LinkedIn presence, use Content Scheduler to maintain a balanced mix of content types:
    </p>
    
    <ul>
        <li><strong>60%</strong> - Educational/valuable insights in your area of expertise</li>
        <li><strong>20%</strong> - Personal professional stories and experiences</li>
        <li><strong>10%</strong> - Industry news and trends with your perspective</li>
        <li><strong>10%</strong> - Promotional content about your services/products</li>
    </ul>
    
    <div class="bg-blue-50 dark:bg-blue-900 p-4 rounded-lg my-6">
        <h4 class="font-semibold mb-2 text-blue-800 dark:text-blue-200">Pro Tip: Batching Content Creation</h4>
        <p class="text-blue-800 dark:text-blue-200">
            Set aside 2-3 hours once a week to create a batch of content using Power Writer. Add all posts to your Content Scheduler queue in one session. This approach is more efficient than creating content daily and helps maintain a consistent voice and theme across your content.
        </p>
    </div>
    
    <h3>Algorithm-Friendly Scheduling</h3>
    <p>
        LinkedIn's algorithm favors certain posting patterns:
    </p>
    
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Spacing out posts</strong> - Allow at least 3-4 hours between posts</li>
        <li><strong>Early engagement window</strong> - Be available to respond to comments in the first hour after posting</li>
        <li><strong>Consistency over volume</strong> - Regular posting on set days is better than sporadic bursts</li>
        <li><strong>Working hours priority</strong> - Content performs best when posted during business hours</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>Integrating with Other LeadsAutopilot Features</h2>
    
    <h3>Content Scheduler + Power Writer</h3>
    <p>
        Create optimized content with Power Writer and send it directly to your Content Scheduler queue. This workflow ensures your posts are both engaging and consistently delivered.
    </p>
    
    <h3>Content Scheduler + Autolikes</h3>
    <p>
        Schedule your content posting times to align with your Autolikes sessions. Posting content just before engaging with others amplifies your visibility in the algorithm.
    </p>
    
    <h3>Content Scheduler + Comments</h3>
    <p>
        Schedule your content across the week, then use the Comments feature to engage with relevant posts during times when you're not publishing your own content.
    </p>
    
    <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
    
    <h3>Can I schedule posts to multiple LinkedIn profiles?</h3>
    <p>
        Yes, Content Scheduler supports multiple LinkedIn profiles. Before adding a post to your queue, select which LinkedIn "seat" (profile) you want to post from. You can maintain separate schedules for each profile.
    </p>
    
    <h3>What happens if LinkedIn is down when my post is scheduled?</h3>
    <p>
        Content Scheduler has a built-in retry mechanism. If a post fails to publish due to LinkedIn API issues or downtime, the system will automatically attempt to repost it up to three times over the next 60 minutes. If all attempts fail, you'll receive a notification and the post will be returned to your queue.
    </p>
    
    <h3>Can I schedule comments on other people's posts?</h3>
    <p>
        Content Scheduler is designed for publishing your own posts. For engaging with others' content, use the Comments feature in LeadsAutopilot, which has its own scheduling capabilities specifically designed for engagement.
    </p>
    
    <h3>Will my scheduled posts look different from manual posts?</h3>
    <p>
        No, posts published through Content Scheduler appear identical to manually published posts. LinkedIn's API ensures that scheduled posts retain all formatting, media, and interactive elements.
    </p>
    
    <h3>How far in advance can I schedule posts?</h3>
    <p>
        Content Scheduler allows you to schedule posts up to 6 months in advance. This is particularly useful for planning content around product launches, industry events, or seasonal campaigns.
