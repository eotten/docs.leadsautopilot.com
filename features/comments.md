    <h2>What is the Comments Feature?</h2>
    <p>
        The Comments feature allows you to identify and engage with high-potential LinkedIn posts through thoughtful comments. Strategic commenting is one of the most underutilized yet powerful techniques for LinkedIn growth, as it puts your profile in front of engaged audiences and showcases your expertise.

    <p>
        By commenting on posts from industry leaders, potential clients, or target accounts, you can dramatically increase your profile visibility and connection rate with minimal time investment.

    <h3>Setting Up Target Profiles</h3>
    <p>
        To get started with strategic commenting:
    </p>
    
    <ol>
        <li>Navigate to the <strong>Comments</strong> section in your LeadsAutopilot dashboard</li>
        <li>Click <strong>Add Target Profile</strong></li>
        <li>Enter the LinkedIn URL of a profile or company you want to monitor</li>
        <li>Set a priority level (High, Medium, Low)</li>
        <li>Choose notification preferences (immediate, daily digest, or none)</li>
        <li>Click <strong>Save Target</strong></li>
    </ol>
    
    <div class="bg-gray-100 dark:bg-gray-700 p-4 rounded-lg my-6">
        <h4 class="font-semibold mb-2">Who Should You Target?</h4>
        <p class="text-gray-600 dark:text-gray-300 mb-4">
            For maximum ROI on your commenting strategy, prioritize these types of LinkedIn profiles:
        </p>
        <ul class="text-gray-600 dark:text-gray-300">
            <li><strong>Industry thought leaders</strong> with large, engaged followings</li>
            <li><strong>Potential clients or decision-makers</strong> in your target companies</li>
            <li><strong>Complementary service providers</strong> (non-competitive but relevant to your audience)</li>
            <li><strong>Active content creators</strong> in your niche who post frequently</li>
            <li><strong>LinkedIn newsletter authors</strong> with substantial subscriber counts</li>
        </ul>
    </div>
    
    <h3>Finding and Engaging with Posts</h3>
    <p>
        Once your targets are set up, you can begin commenting:
    </p>
    
    <ol>
        <li>Open the <strong>Target Feed</strong> to see recent posts from your targets</li>
        <li>Sort by engagement metrics (reactions, comments, or views)</li>
        <li>Select a post to engage with</li>
        <li>Use the <strong>AI Comment Assistant</strong> for inspiration or write your own comment</li>
        <li>Preview your comment and make any final edits</li>
        <li>Click <strong>Post Comment</strong> to publish directly to LinkedIn</li>
    </ol>
    
    <p>
        For maximum impact, try to comment within the first 60 minutes of a post being published. Early comments tend to receive more visibility and engagement.
    </p>
    
    <h3>Keyword Monitoring</h3>
    <p>
        In addition to targeting specific profiles, you can monitor conversations by keywords:
    </p>
    
    <ol>
        <li>Click <strong>Add Keyword Monitor</strong></li>
        <li>Enter relevant keywords or hashtags for your industry</li>
        <li>Set minimum engagement thresholds (e.g., at least 50 reactions)</li>
        <li>Choose notification settings</li>
        <li>Click <strong>Save Monitor</strong></li>
    </ol>
    
    <p>
        Keyword monitoring helps you join relevant conversations even when they're started by people outside your current target list.
    </p>
    
    <h2>Best Practices for LinkedIn Comments</h2>
    
    <h3>Comment Structure</h3>
    <p>
        Effective LinkedIn comments typically follow this structure:
    </p>
    
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Acknowledgment</strong> - Briefly acknowledge the value of the original post</li>
        <li><strong>Value addition</strong> - Add your own insight, experience, or perspective</li>
        <li><strong>Personal touch</strong> - Include a brief personal anecdote or specific example</li>
        <li><strong>Engagement hook</strong> - End with a thoughtful question to encourage replies</li>
    </ol>
    
    <div class="bg-gray-100 dark:bg-gray-700 p-4 rounded-lg my-6">
        <h4 class="font-semibold mb-2">Example Comment Structure:</h4>
        <p class="whitespace-pre-wrap text-gray-600 dark:text-gray-300">
        Great insights on [topic], [Author's First Name]. Your point about [specific aspect] really resonates.
        
        In my experience working with [relevant industry/clients], I've found that [your additional insight or slightly different perspective].
        
        Just last month, we [brief specific example that demonstrates your expertise].
        
        Have you also observed [thoughtful question related to the topic]?
        </p>
    </div>
    
    <h3>Comment Types That Perform Well</h3>
    <p>
        Based on our analysis, these comment approaches tend to generate the most profile views and connections:
    </p>
    
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Experience sharing</strong> - "I've implemented this approach and found..."</li>
        <li><strong>Respectful counterpoints</strong> - "While I agree with most points, I've seen different results with..."</li>
        <li><strong>Data additions</strong> - "To add to this excellent post, recent research shows that..."</li>
        <li><strong>Resource sharing</strong> - "This reminds me of [resource] which expands on this topic..."</li>
        <li><strong>Success stories</strong> - "We applied this principle with a client and achieved..."</li>
    </ul>
    
    <div class="bg-blue-50 dark:bg-blue-900 p-4 rounded-lg my-6">
        <h4 class="font-semibold mb-2 text-blue-800 dark:text-blue-200">Pro Tip: The First-Hour Strategy</h4>
        <p class="text-blue-800 dark:text-blue-200">
            Set up notifications for your highest-priority targets to alert you when they post new content. Commenting within the first hour can place your comment at the top of the thread, significantly increasing its visibility. LinkedIn's algorithm also gives more weight to early engagement.
        </p>
    </div>
    
    <h3>Comment Frequency</h3>
    <p>
        Finding the right commenting frequency is crucial:
    </p>
    
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Per profile:</strong> Comment on 1-2 posts per week from the same person (more can appear excessive)</li>
        <li><strong>Daily total:</strong> Aim for 3-5 quality comments per day across all targets</li>
        <li><strong>Consistency:</strong> Establish a regular commenting schedule rather than sporadic bursts</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>
        Quality always trumps quantity. One thoughtful, value-adding comment is worth more than a dozen generic responses.
    </p>
    
    <h2>Integrating with Other LeadsAutopilot Features</h2>
    
    <h3>Comments + Autolikes</h3>
    <p>
        Use Autolikes to engage with broader content, then focus your commenting efforts on high-priority targets. This two-tiered approach allows you to maintain wide visibility while developing deeper connections with key accounts.
    </p>
    
    <h3>Comments + Power Writer</h3>
    <p>
        Use Power Writer to craft thoughtful comment responses. While designed primarily for posts, Power Writer's ability to optimize engagement and readability works equally well for creating standout comments.
    </p>
    
    <h3>Comments + Content Scheduler</h3>
    <p>
        Coordinate your own content posting with your commenting strategy. After publishing a post via Content Scheduler, use the Comments feature to engage with related content from others in your industry, creating a cohesive presence on the platform.
    </p>
    
    <h2>Measuring Comment Effectiveness</h2>
    
    <p>
        To evaluate and improve your commenting strategy, track these key metrics:
    </p>
    
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Profile view rate</strong> - The percentage of your comments that result in profile views</li>
        <li><strong>Reply rate</strong> - How often the original poster or others reply to your comments</li>
        <li><strong>Connection rate</strong> - The percentage of comments that lead to connection requests</li>
        <li><strong>Engagement quality</strong> - The depth and relevance of conversations stemming from your comments</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>
        LeadsAutopilot automatically tracks these metrics for comments posted through the platform, helping you refine your approach over time.
    </p>
    
    <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
    
    <h3>How is commenting different from Autolikes?</h3>
    <p>
        While Autolikes focuses on lightweight engagement at scale (reacting to many posts), the Comments feature is designed for deeper, more strategic engagement with fewer, high-value targets. Comments require more time investment but typically generate stronger relationship-building results and more direct business opportunities.
    </p>
    
    <h3>Should I use the AI suggestions verbatim?</h3>
    <p>
        The AI Comment Assistant is designed to provide inspiration and structure, not to replace your authentic voice. For best results, use the suggestions as a starting point, then customize them with your specific insights, experiences, and professional tone. Authenticity remains crucial for building genuine connections.
    </p>
    
    <h3>How quickly should I follow up with connection requests?</h3>
    <p>
        If someone likes or replies to your comment, wait 24-48 hours before sending a connection request. This timing appears more natural and gives them time to potentially view your profile first. Include a personalized note referencing the comment conversation when you send the request.
    </p>
    
    <h3>Can I schedule comments in advance?</h3>
    <p>
        Unlike scheduled posts, comments are best made in real-time in response to fresh content. However, you can prepare comment templates for different content types and save them in the system for quick deployment when relevant posts appear.
    </p>
    
    <h3>Is it better to comment on viral posts or less popular ones?</h3>
    <p>
        Both approaches have merit. Comments on viral posts can potentially reach more people but may get lost in crowded threads. Comments on posts with moderate engagement (30-100 reactions) often provide better visibility and higher response rates from the original poster. We recommend a mixed approach, prioritizing recency and relevance over pure engagement numbers.
