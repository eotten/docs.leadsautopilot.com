    <h2>What are Autolikes?</h2>
    <p>
        Autolikes is a powerful feature that automates the process of liking posts on LinkedIn. By engaging with content from your target audience, you can increase your visibility and build relationships without spending hours manually scrolling through your feed.
    </p>
    <p>
        When you like someone's post on LinkedIn, they receive a notification with your name, which can prompt them to check out your profile or connect with you. This creates a non-intrusive way to get on the radar of potential leads or connections.
    </p>
    
    <h2>How to Set Up Autolikes</h2>
    <p>
        Setting up Autolikes is straightforward. Follow these steps to get started:
    </p>
    
    <ol>
        <li>Navigate to the <strong>Autolikes</strong> section in your LeadsAutopilot dashboard</li>
        <li>Toggle the <strong>Enable Auto-Likes</strong> switch to turn on the feature</li>
        <li>Select the LinkedIn seat (account) you want to use for auto-liking</li>
        <li>Choose your preferred auto-like mode (URL Blast or Search Mode)</li>
        <li>Configure your targeting settings based on your chosen mode</li>
        <li>Add any keyword blacklist terms to avoid liking certain content</li>
        <li>Save your settings to activate Autolikes</li>
    </ol>
    
    <h2>Autolikes Modes Explained</h2>
    
    <h3>URL Blast Mode</h3>
    <p>
        In URL Blast Mode, you provide specific LinkedIn URLs for profiles or posts that you want to engage with. This mode is ideal when you have a curated list of people whose content you want to like.
    </p>
    <p>
        URL Blast Mode strategically engages with creators you're currently following and their audience, helping you naturally attract people in your niche. When you engage with content from industry leaders and their followers, you tap into communities of like-minded professionals who are likely to be interested in your expertise.
    </p>
    <p>
        For example, you might add URLs of industry influencers, potential clients, or competitors. LeadsAutopilot will visit these profiles regularly and like their recent posts, as well as engage with their audience's comments and interactions, expanding your visibility within your target niche.
    </p>
    
    <div class="bg-gray-100 dark:bg-gray-700 p-4 rounded-lg my-4">
        <h4 class="font-semibold mb-2">Example URL List:</h4>
        <pre class="whitespace-pre-wrap"><code>https://www.linkedin.com/in/industry-expert1/
https://www.linkedin.com/in/potential-client2/
https://www.linkedin.com/in/thought-leader3/</code></pre>
    </div>
    
    <h3>Search Mode</h3>
    <p>
        Search Mode allows you to automatically like posts that appear in specific LinkedIn search results. This is powerful for targeting content based on keywords, hashtags, or specific search criteria.
    </p>
    <p>
        For instance, you can set LeadsAutopilot to like posts from searches related to your industry, specific job titles, or geographic locations.
    </p>
    
    <div class="bg-gray-100 dark:bg-gray-700 p-4 rounded-lg my-4">
        <h4 class="font-semibold mb-2">Example Search URLs:</h4>
        <pre class="whitespace-pre-wrap"><code>https://www.linkedin.com/search/results/content/?keywords=%22digital%20marketing%22
https://www.linkedin.com/search/results/content/?keywords=%23saascompany
https://www.linkedin.com/search/results/content/?keywords=%22startup%20founder%22</code></pre>
    </div>
    
    <h2>Keyword Blacklist</h2>
    <p>
        The Keyword Blacklist feature helps you avoid liking content that contains specific terms or phrases. This is useful for:
    </p>
    
    <ul>
        <li>Avoiding controversial topics</li>
        <li>Preventing engagement with competitors' promotional content</li>
        <li>Filtering out irrelevant content that might share keywords with your target topics</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>
        Simply add one keyword or phrase per line in the Keyword Blacklist textarea. LeadsAutopilot will scan post content before liking and skip any posts containing these terms.
    </p>

    <h3>Frequency and Volume</h3>

        LinkedIn has certain engagement limits and patterns they monitor for bot activity. To maintain a natural-looking profile activity:
    </p>
    
    <ul>
        <li>Start with 20-30 likes per day and gradually increase over time</li>
        <li>Avoid liking posts too rapidly in succession</li>
        <li>Vary your activity times rather than having all likes occur at the same time each day</li>
        <li>Mix automated likes with some manual engagement for a more authentic presence</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
    
    <h3>Is using Autolikes against LinkedIn's terms of service?</h3>
    <p>
        LinkedIn's terms of service prohibit automated scraping and bulk actions that don't represent authentic user activity. LeadsAutopilot's Autolikes feature is designed to mimic natural human behavior with appropriate delays and randomized patterns to stay within LinkedIn's guidelines. However, we recommend using this feature responsibly and not excessively.
    </p>
    
    <h3>How many likes can I safely automate per day?</h3>
    <p>
        The safe number varies depending on your account's age, size, and normal activity patterns. Generally, starting with 20-30 likes per day and gradually increasing is a conservative approach. LeadsAutopilot monitors LinkedIn's response patterns and automatically adjusts activity to maintain account safety.
    </p>
    
    <h3>Can I use Autolikes with multiple LinkedIn accounts?</h3>
    <p>
        Yes, LeadsAutopilot allows you to use Autolikes with multiple LinkedIn seats (accounts). Each seat can have its own Autolikes configuration tailored to different target audiences or business objectives.
    </p>
    
    <h3>How long before I see results from Autolikes?</h3>
    <p>
        Most users begin to see increased profile views within the first week of implementing Autolikes. For the complete funnel from impressions to clients, expect a 30-60 day cycle for your first conversions, depending on your niche and how well your profile is optimized.
